    <p>
        I am Dhruv Joshi, a student at Government Polytechnic Dehradun, pursuing my diploma in engineering. Passionate
        about technology, I spend most of my time exploring programming languages like C, C++, and C#. My interest lies
        in operating systems, data structures, and web development, and I continuously strive to enhance my skills.<br>

        Apart from academics, I enjoy discussing gaming, tech trends, and performance optimization. I believe in
        learning through hands-on experience and always look for ways to improve my coding and problem-solving
        abilities. With a strong foundation in fundamentals and a keen eye for logic-building, I aim to excel in my
        field and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
